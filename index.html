                    I am Kur Malual, a learner at heart and a student at African leadership university.
                    I am a well-associated person, who associates with people quickly and go along with them,
                    who knows the golden rule of Australia, which says, 
                    "Do to others what you would like them to do to you." I pay attention to anyone 
                    regardless of their status.
                    After high school, I volunteered as a teacher at Concorda highway to help pupils in my community.
                    As a community health worker, I had involved in sustainable work in my community. After that, 
                    I became a Christian outreach assistant for a Christian Agency For Relief and Humanitarian Development.

                <p class="p3">Do something good to everyone regardless of who they are because love is
                    the universal language. Don't give to receive in return but give with the purity of your heart.
